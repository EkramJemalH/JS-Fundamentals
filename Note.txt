##Variable##

Variable=they are container of data value.
inorder to use a varaiable we need to declear and assign the variable 
steps:1.declaration :Ex=let x;
      2.assignment :Ex, x=10;
we have differnet data type including string,integer and boolean

##User input## 

in js we can accept usre input using 2 ways 
      1.using window prompt(Easy way)
      2.using HTML textbox(proffesional way)
using window prompt:this appears in the window alert box 
      Example:let username=window.prompt("what is your user name ");
                        header.textContent=username;
using HTMl textbox:this will appear on the web page
      Example:javascript: 
            const userInput=document.getElementById("input");
            const header=document.getElementById("header");
            document.getElementById("inputBtn").onclick=function() {
                        let user=userInput.value;
                        header.textContent=user;
                  };
            HTML:
            <body>
                  <h1 id="header">Hello</h1>
                  <input type="text" id="input">
                  <button id="inputBtn">Click</button>
                  <script src="script.js"></script>
            </body>

##type conversion## 

 type conversion is converting one datatype into another 
      Example :let x=100;
            x=String(x);//this will change x to string 
            x=boolen(x)//this will change x into boolean value

##Constant## 

const=is a variable that cant be reassigned once it have been decelared and assigned a value

#Math functions ##
      
      In js we have built in maths functions like Math.floor(),Math.random() and etc that allow us to perform a 
      mathimatical equations

##If statements ##
      If statements are conditional statements in which if the condition is true the next ontput will be exetued and if false it will be skipped
      it is just like boolen,true or false simply 

##Checked property## 
      we use it to tell if an an inout which is check box or radio is checked or not

##Ternary Operator##  
      It is a short version of if else statement ,it also checks condition
      syntax:
            condition? ifTrue :ifFalse;

##Switch operator##  
      switch is an alternative that we use to replace many if else statments
 
##Function##  
      functions are reusable code that you can decelare once and use it as many times as u want 
      when ever you want to use you should call it(for execution)
      a function my have an argument u pass,arguments are parameters or info you want to use inside a function
      function also may have a return type 
##Callback## 
      callback is a function that is passed as ana argument to another function,
      it is like"hey when you are done call this next"
      example:
                  bye(hello);
                  function hello(){
                        console.log("hello,again");

                  }
                  function bye(callback){
                        console.log("bye for now");
                  }

                  output:bye for now 
                         hello again

##Foreach method## 
      it is a method used to iterate over an array and applay a callback function to them(doesnt return a new array)
      syntax:array.foreach(callback)....inshort
            array.foreach(function(currentvalue,indexmarray){
                  //code
            })... 

##map method## 
      it is like a foreach ,but return a new array

##filter method## 
      take the same argument as foreach method but return new array that have passed a test or simply filter 

##function experssion## 
      is a way to define function as a value or variable
      example:
      let numebr=[1,12,2,3,4,5,6];
            const square=number.map(function(element){
            return element%2==0;
            })

            output:12,2,4,6

##Object##
      an object is a collection of related properties and methods
      syntax:object={
            key:value,
            function();
      }

##Class##
      provides a more structured and cleaner way to work 
      with objects compared to traditional constructor function
      serves as a blueprint
      new obejects access methods and properties using the dot opertator(.)

##static keyword##
      is a keyweord tat defines properties or method that is dedicated
      to a class itself rahter than the objects creted from that class
      class owns anything that is static and not the object itself

##inheritance## 
      allow class to inherit properties and methods for other existing class
      syntax:
            class Parent{
                   //code
            }
            class Child extends Parent{
                  //code
            }
## Super keyword## 
      refers to the parent constructor it self

##Getter and Setter##
       getter is a function that gets a property value,runs automatically when you read a property(make it readable)
       setter is a function that sets a property value,runs automatically when you assgin a value(make it writtable )
       both are used to validate an input 

##Destructing##
      used to replace elements
      used to assign array elements to variable
      used for extracting value from objects and arrays 
##nested objects## 
      are objects inside another objects 
      we can acess the whole object by a dot operator but to access the inner property we need to use the 
      dot operator twice 
      ex:
            perosn={
                  name:"ekram"
                  address:{
                        number:"124"
                        street:"AA"
                  }
            }
            console.log(person.adress.number)//output 124
      allow you to represent a complex data structure

##Array of objects## 
      this is just like objects but here we have arrays of objects(many objects in one array)

##Sort## 
      method used to sort elemnet of array since it sorts using lexicographics order 
      we need to use a method(function) inside it
      syntax:number.sort((a,b)=>a-b)//this will sort based on increasing 
            number.sort((a,b)=>b-a)//this will sort based on decreasing 
            mainly we us ethis synatx when we are dealing with number

            for strings
      people.sort((a,b)=>a.name.localeCompare(b.name))//increasing 
       people.sort((a,b)=>b.name.localeCompare(a.name))//decreasing

##Date object##
      objects that contain values that represent dates and times
      syntax:
      const date=new Date(year,month,day,hour,minute,second,ms)

##closure##
      a function defines inside of another function,the inner function has access to the variable of the outer

##setTimeout()##
       is a function in js that allows you to sechdule the exection of a function after an amounr of times
       syntax:setTimeout(callback or function,delay);
      clearTimeout(timeoutId)==can cancel a timeout before it trigger

##ES6 Module##
      an external file that contains reusable code that can be 
      imported into other javascript files ,it can conatin any function,variable  

##Sychronous## 
      execture code line by line consecutively in specific manner
      so it waits the above code to finish before executing the next

##Asynchronus## 
      allows multiple opertation to perfomed concurrently(parallel)
      like I/O operation,network request,fetcging data...
      handle with:Callback,promises ,async/await

##Error## 
      is an object that is created when somethg unusal happens
      so we need things to hanlde it 
      try()=the code that may throw an Error
      catch()=catch and handle any thrown Error have one parameter=error
            console.error();
      finally()=always exectues,used mostly to close files,connection and also release resource
